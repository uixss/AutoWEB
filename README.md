## Usage 🛠️

```python
vps_ip = "109.x.218"  # VPS IP address
vps_user = ""         # VPS username
vps_pass = ""         # VPS password

emailmain = ""        # Email for Certbot 📧
domain = ".ru"        # Domain for SSL certificate 🌐

install_apache = True          # Install Apache (True or False) 🏗️
install_php = True             # Install PHP (True or False) 💻
install_certbot = True         # Install Certbot (True or False) 🔐
configure_certbot = False      # Auto configure Certbot (True or False) 🤖
upload_zip = False             # Upload a ZIP file (True or False) 📦
zip_file = "C:/a.zip"          # Local path of the ZIP file to upload 🗂️
```
